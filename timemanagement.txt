Time-management requirements for online and blended courses: 

1. Students should plan to spend *at least* nine focused hours each week on a three-credit online or blended course (or at least six hours each week on a two-credit course, or three hours each week on a one-credit course). For many reasons, some students may find that more hours are required; perhaps many more. Students should plan to accomplish these hours by means of several reasonably short sittings, not one or two huge chunks.

2. An online course may involve several deadlines staggered throughout the week. For example, a student may be required to post in a Discussion Forum on Tuesdays, and to post Replies to others on Fridays. Do not assume that all work will be self-paced, or that deadlines will all fall on a single day of the week.

3. Students should plan to be self-starters, reading the syllabus and any rubrics with care, getting to know the Moodle course management system, keeping a calendar, and striving to stay ahead of weekly expectations. Professors will seek to communicate expectations, but will not normally offer reminders about expectations already articulated in the syllabus and rubrics.
