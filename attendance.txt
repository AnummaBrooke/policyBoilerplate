**face-to-face:**

Attendance at all sessions is required. Each absence reduces one's final grade by a "step" (e.g., from A to A-, then to B+, etc.). Repeated or egregious lateness will be figured as absence. Per Garrett-Evangelical policy, learners missing 20% of sessions should not plan to pass the class.

First-session attendance requirement: learners missing the first session should not plan to pass the class, and should drop. 

**online/blended:**

Participation is expected for all activities except where noted by syllabus.

First-week participation requirement: learners must participate in all activities in the first week of the course, as assigned and on deadline. Those who don't should not expect to pass the class, and should drop.
