Attendance at all sessions is required. Each absence reduces one's final grade by a "step" (e.g., from A to A-, then to B+, etc.). Repeated or egregious lateness will be figured as absence. Per Garrett-Evangelical policy, learners missing 20% of sessions should not plan to pass the class.

First-session attendance requirement: learners missing the first session should not plan to pass the class, and should drop.
